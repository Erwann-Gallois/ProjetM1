want to send her directly so I want her to think that I was doing it to spite her face by did Center brother just because he enjoys my working I said I want to see stuff and I may be that she might have could have misconstrued as being passive aggressive I don't know but but yeah I mean that so bad I thought about that I don't really regret as much as like maybe I could have just let everyone else who wasn't so sure about if I should do stumble upon as opposed to me dragging it to them so just my thoughts are"," tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to make hardest decision I've ever had to make"," it was actually probably probably that was even hard decision with Excel with that the same as score for the mission of us probably cuz I knew I had to break up with her after some stuff happened and is the focus I cared about her great deal but I'll send him to me it wasn't hard to rival the conclusion that I had to break up with her the same time to it was not the easiest thing to try to go through that process it's being on a roller coaster that you're very much aware of how terrible or frightening is going to be but you know you have to get on the roller coaster so that's probably a recent memory"," Just Cabinets for reasons that I this person is probably not the best person for me so I said it was a it was I didn't have to I don't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out it was pretty clear sign and have no regrets about doing it now I feel very strongly then about it I felt so I still feel very strongly that I made the right choice."," How easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can beat it can be tough there will be I feel like it's either 5 if I've exhausted myself during the day between work and the I buy started exercise has a huge help but but I'd say that it's kind of when I get to bed and I never know how it's going to go sometimes it's sometimes I wake up within an hour of falling asleep and can't go back to sleep or Asia periodically keep getting up it up so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but I am especially having my my current girlfriend not around because she's a very big source of comfort I also like that but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and asleep can be consumed as a person that but I'm respecting that someone actually I feel

the assignment there's always just a question like what am I what's going on necks and if I don't have the next project lined up so it's always that nervousness some in the past something usually does come up so we have the president of it usual working up until it dies you always a little anxious and depressed because it's like a you know I chose not very much a lifestyle that while I get that a lot of control and economy over my life it also is all on me in or do it again with sometimes I buy I'm a very jealous of that if you'll just waking up going to the office for 8 hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people are our company carry them through when it's a little tough the words like me if I

need to go back to sleep I'll stay up all day and I'm fine and most people will say that's not enough sleep but you know for me it doesn't affect me"," well it was some things could be different but I'm not dissatisfied I'm happy with my life that they're like with anybody else there's a few things that I wish would different and I think that's an anybody everybody else has no life but I'm content"," yeah I feel a little less motivated"," recently well I can't say recently this was back in January"," my wife and a few friends were noticing that I was becoming forgetful and I couldn't

which is mild cognitive impairment and I've over the last month or so"," nobody has mentioned it to me I'm a man maybe I'm getting better but the neurologist that I saw us as having me come back in a year and going to retest me hopefully it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that I'm away from 52 but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also I was told by him because of the death of my uncle I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things and"," tell work I'm going back in a year and we'll see if I'm any better"," I'm sorry"," I'm not understanding you I'm sorry"," no no I have not"," yes"," 2001"," I was in a what is the word I'm looking for I was in a"," in a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if I didn't seek any help I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder Waring and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and"," I I take medication for that"," well you know it's not really therapy it's you know every few months you know you got to see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it's in alphabet you know kind of like the next person next person that is I am with Kaiser so it sits they'll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that"," you know I okay let's move along you know that they'll hear your explanation but you know they don't have all the time for you that you may want so I'm doing fine now if I really needed help I would I would do something the medication works for me"," last time I felt real happy"," well it would depend on what the event is I'm always happy when I'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and I ain't no I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I don't have anything else she is my world but I enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and

I'm not disappointed or I'm not wanting anything I'm being whatever comes my way is fine so"," well"," I don't know why I couldn't give you that answer I want my best friend is my wife but she would describe me is I don't think before I speak I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over but the big things it's like I let it go and she's bewildered by that"," years and years ago she had a classic Pontiac LeMans and she had got into a minor fender-bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby and I don't worry we'll get it fixed and she what she thought was going to hang or something this was as you know it was my baby and she calls you know you you get excited over nothing but you know I ate something like wrecking your car that you love and he put so many hours of work into it money"," it all gets crashed and it's like you don't care so"," that's the only way I can explain it"," well I need to lose some weight if you could say I'm definitely been on the eating beans and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle I'm here I am this is the heaviest ever been in my life and I'm finding it a little bit harder I can't say harder but I'm finding the willpower"," just say no and stick with it and to go exercise or not you no movement now Gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a"," hey boy you don't look at that wonder what's inside their ER at that's the way that we don't do that no more I guess it's worth a little bit older now and"," trouble heavy retarded to walk with all this weight but I I I wish I could change that because"," this is not a healthy size"," lately"," no I don't regret anything lately everything's been fine the I could say that the biggest"," biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and I never ever"," in a hundred years there ever thought that I would face that situation and I'll never forget it but"," they say time heals all wounds and and it does"," don't listen to other people"," again I'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that I was doing in the pads that I was going down and I constantly thought I knew better and I think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that I was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did I I figured I'd never going to God I'm never going to have those problems I wish I could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I'm able to do I don't miss them but if I could go back 10 or 20 years I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions I made"," my welding certificates I'm certified by the American Welding Society and I have that's probably the biggest achievement that I
